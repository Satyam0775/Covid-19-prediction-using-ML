# **Covid-19-prediction-using-ML**

##ðŸŽ¯Objective

The goal of this project is to predict whether an individual is Covid-19 positive based on minimal symptoms such as fever, cough, age above 60, sore throat, and other related factors.

###ðŸš€ Models Implemented

#Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Inspired by biological neural networks, ANNs consist of layers of interconnected nodes that can learn complex patterns from data. They are particularly well-suited for various prediction tasks.
Gradient Boosting

This ensemble learning technique builds multiple decision trees sequentially. Each tree attempts to correct the errors of the previous ones, resulting in a robust model with high predictive accuracy.
Random Forest

An ensemble of decision trees, Random Forest constructs numerous trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees. This approach reduces overfitting and enhances generalization.
Logistic Regression

A statistical model that utilizes a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. It is simple yet effective for binary classification problems, such as predicting the presence or absence of a disease.
Decision Trees

A non-parametric supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. Decision Trees predict the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
###ðŸ“ˆ Best Performing Model
The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 95.77%. This high accuracy highlights its effectiveness in capturing the complex relationships between symptoms and Covid-19 status.

###ðŸ“Š Performance of the Models Based on Accuracy Scores
The models were evaluated based on their accuracy scores, with the following results:

#Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): 95.77% (Best-performing model)
#Gradient Boosting: Lower than ANN but still highly effective
#Random Forest: Comparable to Gradient Boosting
#Logistic Regression: Effective for simpler relationships
#Decision Trees: Basic model with lower accuracy compared to ensemble methods
These results demonstrate the varying effectiveness of different machine learning models in predicting Covid-19 positivity based on symptoms. The ANN's superior performance underscores its capability in handling complex data patterns.
